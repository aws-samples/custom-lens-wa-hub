This functionality allows applications originally designed for SQL Server to seamlessly integrate with Aurora PostgreSQL, requiring minimal code changes compared to traditional migration methods. Babelfish achieves this by providing an additional endpoint that comprehends the SQL Server wire-level protocol and commonly used SQL Server statements. Client applications utilizing the Tabular Data Stream (TDS) wire protocol can connect directly to the TDS listener port on Aurora PostgreSQL. This approach significantly simplifies the migration process, enabling organizations to transition from SQL Server to PostgreSQL while maintaining compatibility with existing applications and reducing the need for extensive code modifications or changes to database drivers.",

It's important to note that being purpose-built doesn't necessarily mean abandoning the relational model in favor of NoSQL; a relational database can be considered purpose-built when chosen to meet a workload's particular requirements. By leveraging purpose-built databases, .NET application teams can potentially reduce database costs while simultaneously reaping standard cloud benefits such as enhanced scalability, improved resilience, and a significant reduction in undifferentiated heavy lifting.",
